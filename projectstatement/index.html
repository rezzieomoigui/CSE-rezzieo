      Students often struggle to keep their project tasks, deadlines, and important information organized.
      When everything is scattered across different notes and platforms, it becomes easy to lose track of
      what needs to be done. Our project aims to create one clear, centralized website where all project
      details are easy to find. This will help students stay organized, manage their work better, and avoid
      missing important steps.
